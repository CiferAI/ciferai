# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
<br>
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

### Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at info@cifer.ai.  All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.
All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines to address Code of Conduct violations:
1. **Minor Infractions:** For inappropriate language or unprofessional behavior, a private written warning may be issued, explaining the violation. A public apology might be requested.
2. **Serious Violations:** For single incidents or a series of inappropriate actions, a formal warning may be given. This may include temporary restrictions on community interactions, including on social media. Violating these terms could lead to a ban.
3. **Severe Violations:** For major infractions or sustained inappropriate behavior, a temporary ban may be imposed, prohibiting all community interaction for a specified period.
4. **Extreme Cases:** In cases of repeated violations or egregious behavior, a permanent ban may be implemented, excluding the individual from all community spaces.
Enforcement decisions will consider context, community impact, and any history of violations or contributions. The goal is to maintain a healthy, inclusive community environment, not to punish. Community leaders commit to fair, transparent, and respectful enforcement throughout this process.
