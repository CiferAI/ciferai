# Changelog

## \[1.0.14] - 2025-05-30

### ‚úÖ **\[New] Cifer CLI Agent & Kernel Integration**
* Added `cifer` CLI with subcommands:
  * `agent-ace` ‚Äì Run Flask server to download & execute Jupyter Notebooks
  * `register-kernel` ‚Äì Automatically register Jupyter kernel for current Conda environment
  * `download-notebook`, `sync`, and `train` ‚Äì Utility commands for notebook management and testing
* Introduced auto-registration for **üß† Cifer AI Kernel** (`cifer-kernel`) on all CLI usage
* Executed notebooks are now forced to run using the `cifer-kernel` for consistent environment behavior
* Flask agent `/run_notebook` endpoint downloads, executes, and opens notebooks inside Jupyter


## [1.0.13] - 2025-05-10

### ‚úÖ **\[New] Homomorphic Encryption (HE) Support**

* Added `use_encryption=True` flag in both `CiferClient` and `CiferServer`
* Integrated `Paillier` encryption using the `phe` library to secure model weights
* Client now generates a keypair (`public_key`, `private_key`) and encrypts weights before upload
* Encrypted model weights are uploaded via the new `/upload_encrypted_model` API

---

### ‚úÖ **\[New] Server-Side Encrypted Model Aggregation**

* Added `fetch_encrypted_models()` to retrieve encrypted weights from clients
* Implemented `encrypted_fed_avg()` to perform homomorphic FedAvg without decrypting
* Encrypted aggregation output is saved as `aggregated_encrypted_weights.pkl` for client-side decryption

---

### ‚úÖ **\[New] PHP/CodeIgniter API Enhancements**

* Added new API endpoint: `get_encrypted_client_models($project_id)` to fetch encrypted models only
* Validates and stores encrypted models in the `model_updates` table
* Automatically updates the project status to "Testing in Progress" when a model is uploaded

---

### ‚úÖ **\[Fixes] Server Run Script Improvements**

* Automatically creates `model_path` and `dataset_path` if not present
* Added `USE_ENCRYPTION` flag in the run script to easily toggle encryption mode

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Dependencies**

* `phe>=1.5.0` for Paillier homomorphic encryption
* `tensorflow>=2.0`, `numpy>=1.19`

## [1.0.8] - 2025-04-11
